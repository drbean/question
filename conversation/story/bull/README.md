## parses:

A teenagers' soccer game in Australia took an unexpected turn on Saturday when an escaped bull decided to join the game.
The players were running toward the goal when the bull charged the field.
It began chasing the 14-year-old boy who had the ball.
Luckily, the boy was fast, and he managed to get out of the way.
Apparently bored with the soccer game, the bull left the field as suddenly as it had entered it, leaving players and viewers shocked at what they had just witnessed.
