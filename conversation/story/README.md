## bull

	A teenagers' soccer game in Australia took an unexpected turn on Saturday when an escaped bull decided to join the game.
	The players were running toward the goal when the bull charged the field.
	It began chasing the 14-year-old boy who had the ball.
	Luckily, the boy was fast, and he managed to get out of the way.
	Apparently bored with the soccer game, the bull left the field as suddenly as it had entered it, leaving players and viewers shocked at what they had just witnessed.

## tornado

	A 19-year-old by the name of Matt is lucky to be alive and well.

	While he was talking to his grandmother, the storm intensified into a tornado, ripping the walls off the house and sucking him in.
	The tornado took Matt over 1,300 feet before dropping him in an abandoned field.
	After flying through the air at 150 miles per hour, it's safe to say that Matt had the ride of his life!
