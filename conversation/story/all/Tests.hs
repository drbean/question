-- bull

	"A teenagers' soccer game in Australia took an unexpected turn on Saturday when an escaped bull decided to join the game."
	, "The players were running toward the goal when the bull charged the field."
	, "It began chasing the 14-year-old boy who had the ball."
	, "Luckily, the boy was fast, and he managed to get out of the way."
	, "Apparently bored with the soccer game, the bull left the field as suddenly as it had entered it, leaving players and viewers shocked at what they had just witnessed."

-- tornado

	, "A 19-year-old by the name of Matt is lucky to be alive and well."
	, "Matt was watching TV at his grandmother's home in Missouri last Thursday when a terrible storm started."
	, "While he was talking to his grandmother, the storm intensified into a tornado, ripping the walls off the house and sucking him in."
	, "The tornado took Matt over 1,300 feet before dropping him in an abandoned field."
	, "After flying through the air at 150 miles per hour, it's safe to say that Matt had the ride of his life!"


--rescue

	, "Early Tuesday morning in Ontario, two police officers were chasing a car thief when they suddenly lost control of their vehicle and they drove into a river."
	, "Surprisingly, the thief went back to the scene of the accident and he helped rescue the officers from the river."
	, "The local police department dropped all charges against the thief for saving the officers' lives."
