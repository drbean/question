		Carla lived in Saudi Arabia for a while.
		Women put something over their head and they wear clothing that covers the whole body.
		At first, Carla felt uncomfortable and she found it a real nuisance.
		But after a while, Carla got used to it and she even started to like it.
		You feel really secure, and you also don’t have to worry about what to wear all the time.

		When Nate lived in Spain, it surprised him how late in the evening people eat.
		When you are invited to dinner, you are expected to come around nine o’clock, and you usually don’t start dinner until ten o’clock.
		And people stay really late, sometimes until two o’clock in the morning or even later.
		Nate found that difficult.
		How do you get up to go to work the next day after eating and talking until three o’clock in the morning?

		One thing that Shauna had to get used to when she was traveling in South Korea was the way that people make noise when they drink soup.
		Shauna thinks it’s because they want to show that they’re really enjoying their food so they make a slurping noise.
		It bothered Shauna at first, but then she got used to it.
		She guesses it’s because when she was growing up, it wasn’t acceptable to make noise at the dinner table
